class InfoNCE(Module):
    """
    Calculates the InfoNCE loss for self-supervised learning.
    This contrastive loss enforces the embeddings of similar (positive) samples to be close
        and those of different (negative) samples to be distant.
    A query embedding is compared with one positive key and with one or more negative keys.

    Args:
        temperature: Logits are divided by temperature before calculating the cross entropy.
        reduction: Reduction method applied to the output.
            Value must be one of ['none', 'sum', 'mean'].
            See torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy for more details about each option.
        negative_mode: Determines how the (optional) negative_keys are handled.
            Value must be one of ['paired', 'unpaired'].
            If 'paired', then each query sample is paired with a number of negative keys.
            Comparable to a triplet loss, but with multiple negatives per sample.
            If 'unpaired', then the set of negative keys are all unrelated to any positive key.

    Input shape:
        query: (N, D) Tensor with query samples (e.g. embeddings of the input).
        positive_key: (N, D) Tensor with positive samples (e.g. embeddings of augmented input).
        negative_keys (optional): Tensor with negative samples (e.g. embeddings of other inputs)
            If negative_mode = 'paired', then negative_keys is a (N, M, D) Tensor.
            If negative_mode = 'unpaired', then negative_keys is a (M, D) Tensor.
            If None, then the negative keys for a sample are the positive keys for the other samples.

    Returns:
         Value of the InfoNCE Loss.
